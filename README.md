# FlaskWeatherApp

## Project Overview

This project is a Weather Dashboard web application that allows users to access real-time weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It is built using Python and the Flask framework for the backend, while the frontend utilizes Bootstrap for a polished and user-friendly interface. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a convenient and visually appealing way to check the current weather conditions in various locations.

## Project Features

### 1. Python Environment and Flask Framework

- The project starts by setting up a Python environment, ensuring that all necessary dependencies are installed.
- It utilizes Flask, a Python web framework, to create a web application that handles user requests and serves weather data.

### 2. Integration of OpenWeatherMap API

- Real-time weather data is accessed through the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can input the name of a city or a zip code, and the application fetches and displays the current weather information for that location.

### 3. Bootstrap for User Interface Styling

- The user interface is designed using Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework. This ensures a responsive and aesthetically pleasing design across various devices and screen sizes.
